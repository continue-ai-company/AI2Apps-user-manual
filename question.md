### Energy and Consumption
If using a self-deployed AI2Apps environment configured with an OpenAI Key, invoking ChatGPT utilizes the developer's own OpenAI credits without any system-imposed restrictions.
When running/debugging an Agent on www.ai2apps.com, the system covers the costs incurred from ChatGPT calls. To prevent unexpected bills, the system limits ChatGPT usage through an "energy" system.

### Acquire Energy
After successfully registering and logging into Tab-OS, users receive a certain amount of free energy credits. Additionally, each day upon logging in, users receive a replenishment of energy based on their current user level. Successfully referring new members also earns users free system tokens, which can be exchanged for energy credits.
